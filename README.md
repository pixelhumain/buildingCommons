Building Commons
===========

This is repo lists of json-LD structures coming from Building Commons projects (dev-Common,artist-common...) .
It's a list of json-ld structures working on dev-commons projects and are allready final and functional 
Dev-Commons applications share some specifities that make them interoperable: 
- Open Apis
- Common Vocabulary using Web Semantics like schema.org, Activity Streams or any other existing Ontologies/vocabulary
- LinkData (json-LD)

These can be used as starting points, 
but also mean there is an open source and functional project behind  (with it's api)

for the moment we used schema.org but freel free to propose equivalent json-ld translated into othervocabularies like Activity Streams or somthing else 

the subject is still being discussed here https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg
and it seems we'll be moving to activity streams soon or simply generate both formats
