             answer: "By allowing citizens to directly identify problems in their neighbourhoods, cities are able to address problems more quickly and have a better idea of what is happening in the neighbourhoods. Approximately 45% of problems submitted through FixMyStreet are addressed. From the citizen's perspective, Fixmystreet introduces citizens to the benefits of using community tools and communities to new Internet uses. It creates a bridge between stakeholders, promotes exchange and all of it contributes to improving the city. "

It will soon be available in New Zealand. The tool can easily be implemented in other jurisdictions because it was developed in open source. "
