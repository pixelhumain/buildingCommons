This First Meetup was positive
we agreed about collaborative thinking, and building
our first common goal is fairly easy and simple 
Anyone interested in Building commons should use this person model 
to describe themselves minimaly at least in this format 
https://github.com/pixelhumain/buildingCommons/blob/master/person.json
and make it available on a server or commit it here to this repo 
https://github.com/pixelhumain/buildingCommons/members

We'll start the Organization and the Event Json-LD for this event 
in order to build a common usable Person, Organization, Event JSON-LD starting point

The Meeting Process went fairly well
Set up using Doodle 
recorded using Google Hangout on Air : http://youtu.be/R91kOkNgEqY

RDF
	
Bob Haugen	20:50
RDF vs OWL vs JSON-LD?
	
Tibor Katelbach	20:51
OWL is like the RDF's Big Dady
and on top of OWL is OWLD
	
Jon Richter	20:52
JSON-LD is a serialization of RDF, like RDF/XML, Turtle ...
	
Jon Richter	20:53
There was still a second time option in the doodle.
