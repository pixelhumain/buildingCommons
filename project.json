             answer: "By allowing citizens to directly identify problems in their neighbourhoods, cities are able to address problems more quickly and have a better idea of what is happening in the neighbourhoods. Approximately 45% of problems submitted through FixMyStreet are addressed. From the citizen's perspective, Fixmystreet introduces citizens to the benefits of using community tools and communities to new Internet uses. It creates a bridge between stakeholders, promotes exchange and all of it contributes to improving the city. "

             answer: "The British concept of FixMyStreet has been adapted in a number of countries like the Netherlands and Canada where it is maintained by the nonprofit organization VisibleGovernment.ca. It will soon be available in New Zealand. The tool can easily be implemented in other jurisdictions because it was developed in open source. "
